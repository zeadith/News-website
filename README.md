# News-website
I am a frequent reader of [this website](http://tvnwarszawa.pl/ "TVN Warszawa"), and very often on my mobile. Originally, there's no mobile version, so I decided to make one myself. 

It is much simpler and my first ever attempt to code a responsive website, but it looks pretty good. 

I did not write the articles myself, I used real text from the website, as well as the photos to make it look more serious and believable.
Article previews are linked to the real articles.

Instead of inventing or borrowing ads, I used the [zombie ipsum](http://www.zombieipsum.com/) generator.
